In this summer code session, you'll learn about Tableau, a program for making interactive visualizations from tabular data.  It was used to help with scouting and a few free copies were given to teams.  

# A Tableau for Two

Starting out we will talk briefly about data tables.  Tables are a natural way to organize data.  There are other ways such a relational databases but table data is the simplest way.

A table is made of rows and columns.  Usually the first row is the column headers, which describe the content of the column.  For example, in our later exercise we will be putting data on a map from a ".csv" file and in the first row we have the "longitude" and "lattitude", along with other labels for the data in the file.  In the second row you would have the values, like 39.12324 and -89.32323 for the longitude and lattitude.

Spreadsheets are a kind of table that are more complex than only rows and columns.  Excel is the most used spreadsheet.  While many simple tables are written in excel, more complex calculations can be done by writing formula into the cells using built-in functions.  Graphing in Excel is alright, but sometime not   Excel is the most used spreadsheetSpreadsheets are tables (row and columns) that allow for calculations using formulas and functions


Putting information into tables, or tabulating, is a natural way to store and organize information.  However, sharing information in tables can be overwhelming.  Visual representations, such as graphs, plots, diagrams, or figures, help to highlight important features within data.

Take for example this data table of flower stems.  When plotted it becomes apparent that _______________.
