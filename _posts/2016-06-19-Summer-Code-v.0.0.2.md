## Skinny Tableau

We are making a map using Tableau!

Tableau is a data visualization tool.  We are using it because they sponsored copies to FIRST teams.

## Get Tableau

You can download a 14 day trial from <http://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download>.  If you make the best map, I'll get you a product code.

## Find some data

Getting into data analysis can be daunting, but starting with simple tasks you'll find it isn't that difficult.  If stuck, there are so many resources online.  I'll list some in [Resources](http://frc1108.github.io/2016-06-19-Summer-Code-v.0.0.2.html#resources).

The purpose of data analysis is to help when making decisions.  In FIRST, picking other teams for the playoffs is an important decision.  Most teams rely on data from earlier matches to decide which teams they are best with.  
Getting to use the data science toolkit
Getting into programming can be daunting because of the sometimes steep learning curve.  There are many different possible programming languages and programs.  Data science is a 

## Overview



In this code session, you'll be introduced to data analysis software.  The task is making a custom map visualization using **Tableau**.

Many different programs can be used to analyze and visualize data.  In FIRST, many individuals have developed scouting workflows.  A workflow is just a combination of steps that you take to   

In this summer code session, you'll make a custom map using **Tableau**, interactive visualization software.  The skills learned will be introductory topics in data science.

Starting out we will talk briefly about data tables.  Tables are a natural way to organize data.  There are other ways such a relational databases but table data is the simplest way.

A table is made of rows and columns.  Usually the first row is the column headers, which describe the content of the column.  For example, in our later exercise we will be putting data on a map from a ".csv" file and in the first row we have the "longitude" and "lattitude", along with other labels for the data in the file.  In the second row you would have the values, like 39.12324 and -89.32323 for the longitude and lattitude.

Spreadsheets are a kind of table that are more complex than only rows and columns.  Excel is the most used spreadsheet.  While many simple tables are written in excel, more complex calculations can be done by writing formula into the cells using built-in functions.  Graphing in Excel is alright, but sometime not   Excel is the most used spreadsheetSpreadsheets are tables (row and columns) that allow for calculations using formulas and functions


Putting information into tables, or tabulating, is a natural way to store and organize information.  However, sharing information in tables can be overwhelming.  Visual representations, such as graphs, plots, diagrams, or figures, help to highlight important features within data.

Take for example this data table of flower stems.  When plotted it becomes apparent that _______________.
