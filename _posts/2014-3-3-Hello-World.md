This is a placeholder for a re-designed website for the 2016-17 season for Panther Robotics.  I want to migrate the Wordpress blog at <http://www.pantherrobotics.com> here and make the site theme updated.

Right now I am using the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub for style but want to learn how to modify the base style.  I look to sites like <http://www.csswizardry.com> for inspiration.
