# Summer code series v.0.0.1
## Hello World

Building your own website not only is a rite of passage, but is a medium for expressing yourself and your projects.  Recording what you do is a central aspect of science.  So for the first summer code project I invite you to create your own website.  I will give some helpful tips but creativity is encouraged.

## Like a Hacker

There are many tools available for this project, but I encourage using Github pages.  Not only is the hosting free, but it approaches webpages with a hacker mentality.  Git is a version control program, meaning it tracks the changes of files in a project.  Using commands like `git clone`, `git push`, `git pull`, and `git commit` the project files can be managed.  

This website has been hosted on [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and is a clone of the [Jekyll-Now](http://www.github.com/jekyll-now/) project.  Jekyll is a framework for building HTML websites written in markdown.  It is based on the Ruby language.  Jekyll-Now is just one pre-made site that can be customized, with several other possible site themes.  

Markdown is a way of writing in regular plain text and having it become formatted.  For instance, writing `*Italics*` shows up like this:  *Italics*.  Learning to write in Markdown and use Git are useful skill in developing software.

## For non-hackers

These skills also are useful to the non-hacker as they let you write your own story online and share your projects in whatever hobby or work you have.

## The Steps

* Sign up with a GitHub account.
* Clone a jekyll-now project
* Follow the jekyll-now readme instructions
* Make some changes to your site and write a post

Going further:

* Search for other Jekyll themes (and clone to your site)
* Write a post using different markdown features
* Make changes to the Jekyll files (HTML/CSS)

## Goal

Follow through with the steps by **July 15th**.
