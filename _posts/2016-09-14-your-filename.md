## Code zen for a new season
I've been thinking after tonight's meeting about our team philosophy with computer skills.  I'm of the belief that every student should grab onto the computer aspects of their personal interest because our future is being led by those that understand these tools.  

At first, computer software can be daunting, but the teachers are no longer in the classroom but online accessible with a keyword seach.  The collective knowlegde is immense and tapping into it is problem solving in this century.  I feel really uncool to list out sites but I will do it anyway, because robotics isn't always about being cool, it is about doing cool things (look up what Will-i-am says about it).  So you can watch Youtube videos, ask questions of ChiefDelphi or the frc subreddit.  Or you can just type questions into Google.  Or ask Quora. Or Stack Overflow.  Or whatever forum, blog, etc. that you find the help you need.  Or you can ask me, but I probably will be googling it unless I know right away.

Another realization is how little we ask students to work on using computer skills.  There are learning curves we can't possibly hope to teach without self-learning.  We have a busy build season that often takes much of the team in creative design of mechanical systems.  Whether you have a drive system.  A playing piece manipulation and intake system.  A clever stacking system or winch system.  With a team of 20, the robot design and construction are very important for everyone to make a winning robot possible.  However, programming is important and should be given more time and consideration.  Many mechanical tasks can be simplified through programming.  As we saw this year, vision targeting helped teams compete above manual targeting teams.  Next year we don't know how important this may be in the success of the robot.  

For students now, work in the future is almost certainly going to have a software component no matter your interests on the robotics teams, and there should be opportunities on the teams to practice for everybody.  Mechanically minded student should work with CAD.  Artistic student should work with computer graphics.  Media interested students should work with video software, overlay animation software, etc.  Analytic interested students should work with visualization and data science tools.  And robot programmer should work in developing the robot code.  

We've used Labview for the main robot code, but there were a number of teams doing vision computation on external board, in some other languages.  The learning curve to reach this is high, and within a 6 week build period gaining this knowledge is a near impossible climb, but encouraging student here in self-study within a larger frame of things have to be finished (no rouge code).

I'm of belief that all students need a computer skill.  Programming is great and the more students interested the better.  The robot code is less accessible to the full team, but we may be able to have a scouting hack-a-thon accessible to all team members. here is much more that can be, a few students are interesting in programming.  I think here it makes sense to work robot out, so code for its operation is most important programming task for the interested students.  Scouting development is next, and then PR related development (like website and social media).  
We don't have a coding philosophy on 1108 and that is okay. haven't yet came to a coding philosophy on 1108.  There are programming tasks for students of all levels from noobs to gurus.  We start with a
